## 📝 Project Overview
This is an end-to-end data analysis project that involved data handling, analysis, and visualization. The process included:

- Data Modeling and Visualization: Developing an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using Power BI to present key insights.


## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

**SQL & SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):** Used for database queries, management, and initial data extraction.

## 🎯 Conclusion and Recommendations

Based on the analysis, a series of strategic recommendations were developed to optimize pricing and maximize revenue.

* **Conservative Price Increase**: Given the significant price increase in the previous year, a more conservative increase is recommended to avoid reaching a demand ceiling. A price increase in the range of **10-15%** is suggested to test market elasticity without risking a substantial drop in customer volume.

* **Proposed Pricing**: If the 2022 price was $4.99, a **10%** increase would result in a new price of approximately **$5.49**, while a **15%** increase would set the price at approximately **$5.74**.

* **Recommended Strategy**: To inform the final decision, it is advised to conduct further market research on customer satisfaction and competitive pricing. A segmented pricing strategy, differentiating between casual and registered users, should also be considered. Finally, the implementation of any new pricing should be closely monitored and adjusted based on immediate customer feedback and sales data.

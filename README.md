#Toman Bike Share Dashboard
This repository contains the files and documentation for the "Toman Bike Share Dashboard" project. The goal of this project was to create a comprehensive business intelligence dashboard to visualize key performance metrics and support data-driven decision-making for the Toman Bike Share company.

#Project Overview
This is an end-to-end data analysis project that involved data handling, analysis, and visualization. The process included:

Data Source Analysis: Accessing and managing the company's databases.

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Using a combination of SQL and Excel to clean, transform, and prepare the raw data for analysis.

Data Modeling and Visualization: Developing an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using Power BI to present key insights.

#Tools and Technologies
SQL & SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): Used for database queries, management, and initial data extraction.

Microsoft Excel: Utilized for detailed data manipulation, cleaning, and preparation.

Power BI: The primary tool for creating the interactive dashboard, data modeling, and visualization.

#Key Features of the Dashboard
The dashboard provides the following key insights:

Hourly Revenue Analysis: Visualization of revenue performance on an hourly basis to identify peak usage times.

Profit and Revenue Trends: Analysis of revenue and profitability over time to identify growth patterns and areas for improvement.

Seasonal Revenue: Insight into how revenue fluctuates across different seasons.

Rider Demographics: Breakdown of customer demographics to understand the user base.

#Conclusion and Recommendations
Based on the analysis, a series of strategic recommendations were developed to optimize pricing and maximize revenue.

Conservative Price Increase: Given the significant price increase in the previous year, a more conservative increase is recommended to avoid reaching a demand ceiling. A price increase in the range of 10-15% is suggested to test market elasticity without risking a substantial drop in customer volume.

Proposed Pricing: If the 2022 price was $4.99, a 10% increase would result in a new price of approximately $5.49, while a 15% increase would set the price at approximately $5.74.

Recommended Strategy: To inform the final decision, it is advised to conduct further market research on customer satisfaction and competitive pricing. A segmented pricing strategy, differentiating between casual and registered users, should also be considered. Finally, the implementation of any new pricing should be closely monitored and adjusted based on immediate customer feedback and sales data.
